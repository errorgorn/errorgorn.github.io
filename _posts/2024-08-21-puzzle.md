The main strategy is to try to match each piece to its position on the grid if there are details that allow you to do. This works very well for everything that isn't background art.

For the final steps where it is not possible because everything looks pretty much the same (generally black, green, blue/white), the strategy is to use the fact that there is a gradient to everything, which is a very powerful heuristic.
