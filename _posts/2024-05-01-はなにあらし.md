## Bought Entire Series of はなにあらし

So there is this website <https://learnnatively.com/> that has the difficulties of various manga, so I decided to try reading a manga that is about N4 level. I decided to choose はなにあらし.

Managed to snag it for 4000 yen on buyee.

Also, my Japanese anki vocabulary deck is about 650 cards long. For now, my goal is probably to get down the first 1000 terms in <https://core6000.neocities.org/> soon-ish? At least I know the first 100 terms are already in my anki deck, probably most of the first 300-ish is inside as well.
