## Haskell for Advent of Code (Day 1)

I am going to try and fullsolve Advent of Code entirely in Haskell. I've been reading [Hutton's Programming in Haskell](https://www.files.nochill.in/books/haskek/Programming%20in%20Haskell%202nd%20edition%20(%20PDFDrive%20).pdf) over the past few days. I was able to quickly breeze through part 1, but understanding part 2 has proven to be quite difficult. I still don't know what a monad is.

Something that the book doesn't cover is syntatic sugar for not having to do bracket spam by using the `.` and `$` operators. It is described in [this stack overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/940382/what-is-the-difference-between-dot-and-dollar-sign).

[Hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org/) is also really helpful to look up library functions. `transpose` really saved me today, I still had to spend a few hours to fiddle around with a few lines of code... Anyways here is my code for day 1.

```haskell
import System.IO
import Data.List

cnt :: [Int] -> Int -> Int
cnt as v = length ( filter (== v) as )

main :: IO()
main = do inp <- getContents
          print $ sum $ map (\x -> abs ((x!!0)-(x!!1))) $ transpose $ map sort $ transpose $ map (\x -> map read (words x)) $ lines inp
          
          let as:bs:_ = transpose $ map (\x -> map read (words x)) $ lines inp
          print $ sum $ zipWith (*) as $ map (cnt bs) as
```
