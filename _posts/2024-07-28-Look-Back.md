## ルックバック Singapore Premiere

Lookback premiere was today. I did some saikang for the Premiere. My job was to roll up posters so that they didn't get damaged when people brought them home. There were 2 types of posters, A3 posters and A0 posters. I think we rolled like a 400 A3 posters and about 40 A0 posters in total.

But for my work, I was able to get merch and watch the movie for free. I got seat P11 which was at the last row of the cinema and almost in the middle, which arguably is one of the best seats of the cinema. The only downside I felt was that the sound proofing was not too good, you could hear some noise leakage from other cinemas, which is quite bad as some parts of the movie was very quiet. There was also this BGM played through the entire cinema. I could here it at times.

Anyways, here is the merch I got.

The original storyboard seems to be very similar to the actual one-shot, from what I recall, although I only read the English translated one so far. One thing to notice is that the names were different in the one-shot. In the one-shot, the names are 藤野 and 京本 while in the storyboard, they were 三船 and 野々瀬. The reason for this change was probably cause the mangaka wanted to make the link to the kyoani arson incident more obvious I guess (藤本, 京アニ)?

Also, I read a few pages of the storyboard before I went to see the movie. One thing I noticed is that the dialogue in the movie is almost a one-for-one match with the dialogue in the storyboard. It seems very interesting to me that the adaptation was so faithful to the source material to not even paraphrase dialouges.

There was also quite a few references to Fujimoto's other work. I didn't really dig into his work much so I only know about chainsaw man, from reading the manga. Shark Kick is obviously a reference to chainsaw man, with the scene of the album covers directly referencing it. The manga assistant is also a clone of Kobeni. I did not get the reference but apparently there was a scene that is a reference to the final panel of sayanara Eri.

There was also a small batch of A0 posters. Being a staff, I saw that there was a A0 poster taped onto a box, so i removed the tape and took out the poster. They were going to throw it away anyways.

There was alot of sticky tape residue left on the poster, but I rolled it up anyways to bring it home. After I brought it home, some parts of the poster tore and I had to remove them manually using a pen knife. I think a did a decent job? If you didn't pay attention, you probably couldn't see the tiny defects... I tried to also clean the residue using soap water but gave up half way because it wasn't really working. Well, whatever, I'm just going to leave it inside a cupboard anyways, I have no idea where to display this also.
