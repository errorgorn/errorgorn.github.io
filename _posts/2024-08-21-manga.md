I know this looks like a lot of manga. But I think I spent more on figures. The cast-off roxy figurine wasn't cheap.

Here is the breakdown of the cost (plus or minus a bit due to exchange rate calculations): 

| Title                 | Cost of Manga (SGD) | Cost of Local Shipping (SGD) | Remaining Costs (Proxy, Intl Shpping, Tax) (SGD) |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| はなにあらし          | 35                  | 8                            | 54                                               |
| ハピネス              | 10                  | 7                            | 21                                               |
| the rest of the manga | 162                 | 77                           | 190                                              |

Note that some of the listed manga have the local shipment fees absorbed by the seller. In which case, the cost of the Manga itself will naturally be more expensive. Anyways, we can see here I spent about half a thousand on Manga.

Notice an anomaly? The remaining costs for はなにあらし should not be so much. Do you want to know why?

I used Buyee for はなにあらし and zenmarket for the rest. If there is anything you want to take away from this blog other than I am a stinky weeb, it is that **do not use Buyee**.

The entire Buyee fiasco went like this:

- Seller sends 4 packages to Buyee
- Buyee receives 1 package from seller and notifies me, so I immediately ship it, I should have noticed that the weight of the parcel was unusually light here
- Buyee receive 3 more packages from the seller and notifies me
- I write email to them tell them wtf, but their customer service seems a bit stupid, so whatever, I can't do anything about it
- I consolidate the packages
- Buyee forces me to put a tax amount on each item because all the items did not have any tax, which was not allowed, but I already paid all the tax needed for the first package, why do they allow users to set their own tax value but after you set them, they cannot be changed?
- I wrote more emails to them to ask them if they can manually change the tax amount to something else, but i realize that **everytime you write a email to buyee customer support, the person changes**. You need to keep adding more and more context to your emails until they become an entire essay just to tell them that they screwed up (my situation here was not easy to explain concisely).
- At the end, they agreed to refund me an entire \\$3. I realized it was kind of wasting my time arguing with such stupid people and just paid the unneeded tax

So that is the story of how Buyee made me rack up \\$54 in random costs for sending less than 1.5kg of manga.

# FUCK BUYEE
