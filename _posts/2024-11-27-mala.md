## Mala Chicken McCrispy

I have ate this on two occasions. The first time I ate it at Clementi mall on 12th November. There was still MLBB collab.

The second time I ate it was 27th November when there was [1 for 1 Mala McCrispy](https://www.greatdeals.com.sg/2024/11/24/mcdonalds-1-for-1-mala-chicken-mccrispy-double-cheeseburger-meal-deals-nov-2024). I went with bunkmates. We decided to go cookhouse first to get more free food. Then cookhouse was western and we went at like 6pm when it was almost closing. So aunty give free flow. So we go spam chicken at cookhouse. Then after that go mcdonalds. In mcdonalds I wanted to get the 1 for 1 Mala McCrispy and also want to try the Smoky BBQ Shaka Shaka Chicken McBites cause I could redeem from points.

When I ate it at clem mall, I found it ok, but nothing special, just wanted to try it. It was not spicy at all. I think the ma also not that much. And the skin is not crispy, unlike the normal McCrispy. But whatever, I redeemed points from McD app.

But for some reason, when I ate it at Yishun McD my first bite felt really bad. Like it was super oily and dry at the same time. It was unironically worse than cookhouse food. I bed my bunkmate to trade 1 piece of chicken for something else more palatable. I think it is just because it is Yishun. Fuck Yishun.

Later when I go back unit, my stomach very pain. I try to vomit in air force toilet. Did not work. Would not recommend Mala McCrispy.

Btw, the smoky BBQ Shaka Shaka Chicken McBites is also bad, but edible. Usually shaker stuff is rly good but this one taste really weird. The shaker taste like nothing. Maybe smoky shaker means ash-flavour.
