## Reading Fromkin's Introduction to Language

This is probably the most advanced form of procrastination where I study Japanese to procrastinate studying for AP exams and I study linguistics to procrastinate studing Japanese.

Anyways, I wanted to learn Linguistics formally, so after asking around for a recommended beginner textbook, I was recommended Fromkin.

I have read the first chapter and a bit of the second chapter, it seems interesting so far. I have learnt a phenomenon called rebracketing where compound words change in their compounds in the minds of native speakers. 2 notable examples are helico+pter → heli+copter and hamburg+er → ham+burger.

Also, after using anki for about a week learning Japanese vocab, I thought I would try using it to better study this textbook, we will see how it goes. If it goes well, I will probably anki-fy all my learning.
