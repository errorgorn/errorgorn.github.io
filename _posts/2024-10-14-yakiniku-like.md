## Yakiniku Like Buffet

[Yakiniku Like has buffet for $26.90 at PLQ Mall](https://www.instagram.com/p/DAgO48OKFhU/). I took off from NS to go.

The only thing that you need to note is that unlike other buffets where the timer is the amount of time you are allowed to order food, here you need to finish everything by the time the timer ends.

I didn't know about this when eating so I had like 400g of karubi left when the timer ran out and the aunty ask us to extend our buffet by 30mins for $10. Luckily we told the aunty to give us 5 more minutes and we managed to somewhat cook all the meat. It's a bit pink but I'll probably be fine.

I think this is one of the few buffets where you will actually stop eating because of the timer, because the grill provided at yakiniku like is really small. I only managed to fit 4 pieces of karubi on the grill at a time. And you are forced to clear the initial serving of chicken which takes forever to cook, and I'm not risking getting salmonella.

While I definitely had more space if there was more time, it was still crazy good value. I think I managed to eat more than 1.5kg of meat? I would definitely come again. I feel like I scammed them.
