Decided to give the satay burger a try since they were offering a 1 for 1 price. I liked the beef satay burger better than the chicken satay burger. I think the reason is because the taste of the beef itself taste more like the flavour one gets from cooking satay on charcoal, which I don't know how to describe. The chicken patty on the chicken satay burger is pretty much cookhouse chicken. Also, when I was eating the chicken satay burger, the chicken patty slid out of the burger, so the entire chicken patty was gone when I still had half the breads left.
