## Started Trying to Learn Hokkien

Decided it was probably time to start learning Hokkien from my parents or I will never be able to speak their native language.

For orthography, I will use a modified version of [Tâi-lô](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singaporean_Hokkien#Phonology), where my modifications are:

- ts → q
- iau → iao
- Tone marking system changed to be closer to 汉语拼音 in Mandarin Chinese. Specifically:

| Word | Tâi-lô | Modified |
| ---- | ------ | -------- |
| 詩   | si     | sī       |
| 死   | sí     | sì       |
| 四   | sì     | sǐ       |
| 薛   | sih    | sìh      |
| 時   | sî     | sí       |
| 是   | sī     | sǐ       |
| 蝕   | si̍h    | síh      |

Note that it seems that tones 3 and 6 have been merged together. Also note that the Mandarin Chinese rule of [third tone sandhi rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chinese_phonology#Third_tone_sandhi) seems to be followed here.

Also, the sound /kʰ/ doesn't seem to exist. Or I just can't tell apart /k/ and /kʰ/.

Below are some words that I know. Note that their Chinese translations might be not be they are "officially" written. For example, tsiǎ is suppose to be written as 食, but it is semantically closer to 吃 in Mandarin Chinese. I use Chinese instead of English translations because the Chinese translations will *probably* be more semantically similar.

Here are some example setences and their (semantic) Chinese translations:

- 吃饱吗, jiǎ bà běr, how are you
- 你吃了吗, lìr jiǎ běr, how are you
- 这是我的第一大的大姐, tsé sǐ wà ě dě ìt ě duǎ jìh, this is my oldest sister
- 小妹是猪, sío běr sǐ tīr, little sister is stupid

I also need to figure out the grammar one day...
