## Started Trying to Learn Hokkien

Decided it was probably time to start learning Hokkien from my parents or I will never be able to speak their native language.

For orthography, I will use a modified version of [Tâi-lô](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singaporean_Hokkien#Phonology), where I will use a tone marking system that is closer to 汉语拼音 in Mandarin Chinese.

Specifically:

| Word | Original | Modified |
| ---- | -------- | -------- |
| 詩   | si       | sī       |
| 死   | sí       | sì       |
| 四   | sì       | sǐ       |
| 薛   | sih      | sìh      |
| 時   | sî       | sí       |
| 是   | sī       | sǐ       |
| 蝕   | si̍h      | síh      |

Note that it seems that tones 3 and 6 have been merged together. Also note that the Mandarin Chinese rule of [third tone sandhi rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chinese_phonology#Third_tone_sandhi) seems to be followed here.

Also, the sounds /dz/ and /dʑ/ don't even seem to exist, or have gotten merged into something else, probably /ts/ and /tɕ/.

Below are some words that I know. Note that their Chinese translations might be not be they are "officially" written. For example, tsiǎ is suppose to be written as 食, but it is semantically closer to 吃 in Mandarin Chinese. I use Chinese instead of English translations because the Chinese translations will probably be more semantically similar.

| Chinese Translation | Hokkien Pronounciation |
| ---- | ---- |
|零| khǒng|
|一| ìt|
|二| lǐ|
|三| sānn|
|四| sǐ|
|五| gǒnn|
|六| làk|
|七| tsìk|
|八| puèh|
|九| kuà|
|十| tsàp|
|吃| tsiǎ|
|饱| bà|
|无| bó|
|饭| pňg|
|买| buè|
|卖| buě|
|会| ě|
|是| sǐ|
|的| ě|
|话| uě|
|讲| góng|
|这| tsé|
|屎| saì|
|什么| sí mì|
|妈| má|
|爸| bá|
|妻| bò|
|哥| góh|
|小弟| sío dǐ|
|小妹| sío běr|
|大姐| duǎ jìh|
|阿奶| ā mà|
|假強| ké khiǎng|
|猪| tīr|
|肉| bàk|
|我| wà |
|你| lìr |
|他/她| ī |

Here are some example setences and their (semantic) Chinese translations:

- 吃饱吗, jiǎ bà běr, how are you
- 你吃了吗, jiǎ běr, how are you
- 这是我的第一大的大姐, tsé sǐ wà ě dě ìt ě duǎ jìh, this is my oldest sister
