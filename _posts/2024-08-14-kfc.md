## KFC Mala Gold Spice Box

Now, before I write anymore. I want to note that this meal costs \\$12.85. With the current prices of food, it maybe isn't that unreasonable since this is the "premium" one person meal of mala gold spice that KFC offers. We note that a double mcspicy costs \\$11.25, this will be our benchmark for the mala gold spice box.

How are was it? The skin of the chicken was very nice, it was spicy and had a small taste of salted egg flavour that I guess everyone is spamming into food now. But the portion was very small. KFC regularly provides lunch during NDP, in which I take multiple boxes cause there is always a surplus, and the chicken were still quite reasonably sized. But for some reason, this one felt really small. The tenders and fries were not even hot.

This was definitely not worth the money I paid. The last time I went to KFC, it was when they had the 4 piece chicken meal for $10 back in December of 2023, so I felt that I got my money's worth even though the chicken felt smaller than usual. But maybe this is their actual chicken sizes moving forward. Perhaps they tried to bait us with free larger chicken during NDP.

Anyways, I think I'm not going to visit KFC anytime soon. They suck now

Given that the flavour profile is spicy with the salted egg taste, I think one would have more enjoyment if they buy the Irvin's hot boom fish skin for less than $10 in NTUC.
