## Karaoke Music Video Maker

Yesterday I went to to karaoke with friends. The Japanese song selection was extremely hard to navigate and we couldn't find any songs that we wanted to sing. Luckily they have an option to just stream music from youtube. But the quality of the karaoke music videos there are not always the best.

These are the kind of videos we were using are:

- <https://youtu.be/3stAaLqFfYY>

Which I know not super good, so I did what any sane person would do and spend a few hours coding something to make karaoke music videos.

The github repo can found at <https://github.com/errorgorn/karaoke-mv-maker>. It is probably quite a big hassle to use it as you need to get quite a few packages working first...

But you can view an example karaoke MV that I made at <https://youtu.be/2e7mT5trj6w>.
