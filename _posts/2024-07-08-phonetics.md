## Consonant Phoneme English and Chinese Reference

These are the sounds of several phonemes in the way I pronounce English/Chinese. My pronounciation of Chinese is quite diferent from someone who speaks it natively becacause of skill issue.

Note that for Chinese, "X/Y" denotes that X is unaspirated whereas Y is aspirated, since Chinese distinguishes between aspiration.

Note that the table for English is mostly taken from Fromkin's Introduction to Language.

notes:

- I seem to separate voiced and unvoiced phonemes by aspiration in both languages
- I do not distinguish [w] and [ʍ], so witch and which are pronounced with [w]
- I do not retroflex in Chinese, so [ʂ], [ɻ] and [ʈ͡ʂ] becomes [ʃ], [ɹ] and [t͡ʃ ].
- For some strange reason for the minimal pairs which distinguish between aspirated and unaspirated, only for 肚 and 兔 does my pronunciation also distinguish between the place of articulation shifting 肚 from /tu/ to /du/, but I am not really sure
