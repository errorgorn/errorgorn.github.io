## Consonant Phoneme English and Chinese Reference

These are the sounds of several phonemes in the way I pronounce English/Chinese. My pronounciation of Chinese is quite diferent from someone who speaks it natively becacause of skill issue.

Note that for Chinese, "X/Y" denotes that X is unaspirated whereas Y is aspirated, since Chinese distinguishes between aspiration.

Note that the table for English is mostly taken from Fromkin's Introduction to Language.

| d͡ʒ   | voiced post-alveolar affricate      | **j**eez    |         |

notes:

- I seem to separate voiced and unvoiced phonemes by aspiration in both languages
- I do not distinguish [w] and [ʍ], so witch and which are pronounced with [w]
- I do not retroflex in Chinese, so [ʂ], [ɻ] and [ʈ͡ʂ] becomes [ʃ], [ɹ] and [t͡ʃ ].
- All avolo-palatal consonants (西 [ɕ], 讲 [t͡ɕ], 枪 [t͡ɕʰ]) have been shifted to aveolar ([s], [t͡s], [t͡sʰ])
