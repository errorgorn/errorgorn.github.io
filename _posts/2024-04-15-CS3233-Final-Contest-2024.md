## CS3233 Final Contest 2024

I solved ABFHJK in CS3233 final contest. Here are my thoughts:

- A:  shit constant time TLE, also oolimry got trolled, I had to solve for him L
- B: literally copy $O(n^\frac 1 4)$ factorization from kactl and first blood
- F: not that interesting, large $n$ force me to use KMP, which I never used in like 3 years
- H: I got trolled by the function and started expanding it immediately cause it seemed like convex hull. I was lucky to draw points on paper, then I realized that this cost function was literally euclidean distance. Funny troll problem.
- J: It is quite obvious that $ans \leq 1$. Checking that $ans=0$ literally just involves simulating the path of Alice. Quite boring.
- K: Standard suffix array/tree problem

The other problems:

- C: I told pavement it was $V-E+F = 2$​​ thing and he bashed the math L
- D: we tried finding example graphs for small $n$, idk. For odd $n$, obviously only good graph is complete graph
- E: idk bro, oolimry: "my only contribution was to theory solve E"
- G: i only knew it was DAG+flow
- I: conjecture: bob only wins if the xorsum of terminal nodes is 0 and the rest of the nodes have 0 value. Rama says it is false L. Counterexample: the graph of 4 vertices $1 \to 0 \quad 1 \to 0$.
- L: observation: each row of lasers left/right shifts a subsequence. idk how to proceed after that
- M: didnt read
