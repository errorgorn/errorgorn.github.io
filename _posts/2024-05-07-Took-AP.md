## Experience Taking AP Stats Exam

I took AP Statistics exam with [Prometric](https://www.prometric.com/CBAPSG) today, observe that they charge 223USD per exam instead of the usual 128USD.

Here is my experience:

- I showed up 1 hour earlier than usual according to the email, turns out almost no one was there and they took 40 mins before the exam started just to do security checks on everyone
- the security check checked your glasses, ears, pockets, socks area, and used metal detector, they also did passport check
- proctor was not aware that 2 calculators can be brought
- some proctors evidently could not tell difference between graphing and scientific calculator
- proctor read instruction quickly and while mumbling, I could not understand the exam rules
- proctor did not give enough time to shade personal in the mcq answer sheet and just rambled on and on
- proctor did not clear GC, despite requiring metal detector check and passport. this is literally the easiest way to cheat
- we did the exam in a university room with a digital clock that was out of sync. It even jumps back time for some weird reason. they brought 2 analogue clocks but one of them fell off the hook and broke before the exam so i could barely see the only correct clock in the exam hall. **EDIT:** for AP CS, there were no analogue clocks, the only possible way to figure out how much time you had left near the end of the exam was to ask the invigilators
- proctor place my pencils and erasers on floor during FRQ despite rules clearly saying that they could be used (so they didnt even bother understanding what they read), indeed AP Statistics have graphing questions inside the FRQ where one would probably want to use pencils

Why the fuck did I pay an extra 100USD for this nonsense

On a side note, 2 absolute legends decided to raw dog it and not bring GC

Also here are some stupid AP Stats questions that I encountered while studying.
