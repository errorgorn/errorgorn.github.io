I also received a Propnex Monopoly set which [costs $40](https://monopoly.propnex.com/account/game_rules). Some sergeant told me I could probably sell it on carosell for \\$30.

I have no idea what I did to deserve this tbh, I just do the bare minimum and use my phone on the job a lot. Last week they gave it to an NSF officer was kind of the de facto IC of our group so it made sense. Idk why they picked me over all the other men, but ok.
