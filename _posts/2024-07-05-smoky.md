With upsized meal, this cost \\$9.90. If you added another \\$2, I think you can just buy double mcspicy already. 

This gives me vibes of $2 burger you buy in primary school, and it probably tastes worse than it. I think if you take white bread from your house and buy the chicken cutlet from SAF canteen and add some random sauce, it will probably taste about the same and be a lot cheaper. 0/10 tbh'

I think the sauce taste like ranch?
