## IOI-chan

IOI 2024 is coming soon. I remembered that my mascot for IOI 2022 is kind of a meme, so I wanted to archive pictures of it. Btw, Prof Halim actually offered me to be a guest for IOI 2024, but I turned down the offer because

- I was going to OCPC onsite already
- I felt bad if I took the spot of the actual IOI trainer

But it seems that the only strong onsite teams that are coming for OCPC is my team and kostia's team. Furthermore, it seems the IOI trainer is not going to IOI anyways.

Well, whatever, here is IOI-chan that I used as a mascot for IOI 2022.

This photo was actually taken from [the official IOI site](https://ioi2022.id/2022/08/day-2-practice-session/), which I am very proud of. So let's preserve it here before the site gets taken down.
