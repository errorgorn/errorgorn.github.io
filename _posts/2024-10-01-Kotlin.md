## Kotlin CP Reference

Today, I participated in [Kotlin Heros 11](https://codeforces.com/contest/2011). I got 4th place, narrowly missing out on getting USD128 :( Anyways, I have participated in a few Kotlin Heros contests before but today is the first time where I actually coded mainly in Kotlin, as in previous contests, I just coded in C++ and use gpt to convert to Kotlin...  so here is my reference to my future self for future editions of Kotlin Heros

### Compilation

```
$ kotlinc A.kt
$ kotlin AKt.class
```

Compiling a Kotlin file produces some `.class` files, one for the the entire program and others for various classes in your program. As far as I can tell, the main `.class` is named `{X}Kt.class`? I don't know a way to change it either, so that's about it

### IO

I forgot where i copied this from, but this is fast

```kotlin
import java.io.BufferedReader
import java.io.InputStream
import java.io.InputStreamReader
import java.util.*

import kotlin.math.*
 
class Reader(inputStream: InputStream) {
  private val reader = BufferedReader(InputStreamReader(inputStream))
  private var tokenizer: StringTokenizer? = null
 
  fun next(): String {
    while (true) {
      tokenizer.let {
        if (it == null || !it.hasMoreTokens()) {
          tokenizer = StringTokenizer(reader.readLine())
        } else {
          return it.nextToken()
        }
      }
    }
  } 
}
val reader = Reader(System.`in`)
fun read() = reader.next()
fun readInt() = read().toInt()
fun readLong() = read().toLong()
fun readDouble() = read().toDouble()
fun readStrings(n: Int) = Array(n) { read() }
fun readInts(n: Int) = IntArray(n) { readInt() }
fun readLongs(n: Int) = LongArray(n) { readLong() }
fun readDoubles(n: Int) = DoubleArray(n) { readDouble() }
```

Output is quite simple, it is `print()` and `println()` which is quite intuitive to use

Both functions accepts template arguments such as `print("$a $b")`, be careful when printing `a[i]` as we have to do `print("${a[i]}")` or else our compiler will think that we are doing `print("${a}[i]")`.

### Basic Syntax

Variables are declared as `var name:type = value`, we can omit either `type` or `value` (**but not both**) and the compiler will infer it

Kotlin does not have automatic type upgrading, that means you cannot assign a `Long` value to a `Int`. This is particularly annoying if you are like me and use `#define int long long` because array indices are forced to be `Int`. Another annoying case is that in C++ we are used to doing stuff like `if (x)` to check that `Int x` is not zero, but in Kotlin, we need to explicitly make it into a `Boolean` expression

**Bitwise operations have totally different syntax**, see <https://www.programiz.com/kotlin-programming/bitwise>
tl;dr, the operations are `or`, `and`, `xor`, `inv()`, `shl` and `shr` 

For loops have the following syntax

```kotlin
for (i in a..b)
for (i in b downTo a)
for (i in a..b step c)
for (i in b downTo a step c)
```

The equivalent code in C++ is

```c++
for (int i=a;i<=b;i++)
for (int i=b;i>=a;i--)
for (int i=a;i<=b;i+=c)
for (int i=b;i>=a;i-=c)
```

A useful loop in Kotlin is `repeat(x){}`, for problems with multitest, it is useful to write `repeat(readInt()){}`

Functions have the syntax `fun name(arg1:type1, arg2:type2):type {}`, `type` can be ommitted when the compiler can infer it but the argument types cannot be ommited.

Suppose we want to unpack the elements of an array `arr`, the correct syntax is `var (a,b,c) = arr`, this is most useful when reading multiple variables where we can write `var (a,b,c) = readInts(3)`.

We can also import whatever class we want from Java. An example is [CF1958H](https://codeforces.com/contest/1958/problem/H) where we have to use big integer, so we just import `import java.math.BigInteger`.

### Pairs and Structs

Pairs are supported natively in Kotlin. The datatype is defined by `Pair<type1,type2>`, but of course we can omit it when defining variables to give the syntax `var a = Pair(v1,v2)`. We access elements as `a.first` and `a.second`

The analogue of structs is `data`, see <https://kotlinlang.org/docs/data-classes.html>.

The syntax is quite intuitive, you create a new `data` with `data class A(var a: type1, var b: type1)`, create a new object with `var obj = A(x,y)` and then access variables inside objects with `obj.a` and `obj.b`.

### Lists and Sorting

Arrays have the syntax `var arr = Array<type>(len){ value }`, we can omit either type **but cannot omit value**. Therefore something like a 2D array can be defined like `var arr = Array(len){ Array(len2){0} }`, where it is shorthand for the super long `var arr = Array<Array<Int>>(len){ Array<Int>(len2){0} }`. Accessing and modifying elements is the usual `arr[x]`.

ArrayLists are same as Java ArrayList, the syntax is:

- `var v = ArrayList<type>()`, initialization
- `v[x]`, accesses the `x`-th element
- `v.add(x)`, appends `x` to end of `v`
- `v.last()`, access the last element of `v`
- `v.removeLast()`, pops the last element of `v`

Syntax for sorting is `arr.sort()`, we can also sort by customer comparator with syntax `arr.sortWith(compareBy{brr[it]});`

### Segment Tree

Code taken from <https://codeforces.com/contest/1571/submission/236726134>.

```kotlin
class Seg(){
	var arr : Array<Long> = Array(300005*4){-1000000000000000000}
	
	fun update(i:Int, k:Long, s:Int = 0, e:Int = 300005, u:Int = 1){
		var m=(s+e)/2
		arr[u]=max(arr[u],k)
		
		if (s==e) return
		else{
			if (i<=m) update(i,k,s,m,u*2)
			else update(i,k,m+1,e,u*2+1)
		}
	}
	
	fun query(i:Int,j:Int, s:Int = 0, e:Int=300005,u:Int=1):Long{
		var m=(s+e)/2
		
		if (s==i && e==j) return arr[u]
		else if (j<=m) return query(i,j,s,m,u*2)
		else if (m<i) return query(i,j,m+1,e,u*2+1)
		else return max(query(i,m,s,m,u*2),query(m+1,j,m+1,e,u*2+1))
	}
}
```
