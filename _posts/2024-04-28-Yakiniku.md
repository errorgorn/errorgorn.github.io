## McDonald's Yakiniku Burger

Decided to try the new yakiniku burger cause there was a discount.

It looks sad, and the taste is even sadder. I choose the chicken version because beef seemed too "safe" and I wanted to see whether yakiniku-flavoured chicken even makes sense. It turns out that they just spammed the sauce and you can't actually taste anything else. The sauce just tastes like a milder black pepper sauce, you don't get any smoky taste that you get from yakiniku.

Honestly, this was a waste of money. Just add a few dollars more to get the double mcspicy meal.

**EDIT:**

I guess McDonald's no one likes the new burger and are just giving out... but I was not free to get it
