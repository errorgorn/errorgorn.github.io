## Bocchi Figurines

So remember <https://errorgorn.github.io/2024/06/09/DDAM.html>, where I bought a Bocchi figurine. I went to La Tendo after going to the con and I saw the bocchi figurine. It was $30 so I thought it was a good price.

Then I later realized that it was part of a set of 4 figures with the whole band. So I just bought everything...

I think it is peak consumerism that I am here blogging about spending money on more stupid pieces of plastic. But here we are.
