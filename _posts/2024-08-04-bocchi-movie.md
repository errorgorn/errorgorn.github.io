As for the movie itself, only the first few minutes was actually original, where they segued into the new song 月並みに輝け. Everything else was probably direct ctrl+C ctrl+V from the anime... but I guessed that's what I paid for by watching a recap movie

Btw, I think I saw exactly 1 girl at the entire cinema
